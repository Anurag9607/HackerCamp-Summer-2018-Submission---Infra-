# max files 
I'm using heap library to reduce the time complexity and win32api
I'm checking each and every file and comparing their size with the best 10 files found till that time using heap pushpop.
in case of window i'm not giving the path it automatically check the whole pc
in case ubuntu or other we give path manually


# organizing desktop
The code is written and tested in ubuntu in case of window file directory needs to be changed
Here I'm defining two function one for creating folder and one for moving folder
in the main function I'm creating dictionary of file types
and I'm coverting name of all extensions in lower case 
If needed than by replacing lower with upper we can create folders in upper case
